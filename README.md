# Handwriting Recognition for Medical Documents

## Background

The medical field often struggles with deciphering doctors' handwriting, leading to misinterpretations. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a handwriting recognition system specifically for medical documents. Leveraging machine learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets), for image detection has shown promising results in recent times. Our initiative focuses on implementing a multi-classification algorithm and a detection approach to identify handwritten notes and prescriptions of medical personnel.

## Objectives

- Improve patient care
- Increase efficiency
- Enhance data accessibility

## Motivation and Significance

With the increasing population, health institutions face a divided era of health provisions. Communication between health providers heavily relies on handwritten notes and prescriptions, which are often difficult to decipher. A system that accurately interprets doctors' handwriting can minimize medication errors, enhance diagnosis accuracy, and streamline data entry, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. Additionally, automation can free up healthcare professionals' time for patient care and administrative tasks. Accurate transcriptions in electronic medical records can facilitate research, public health initiatives, and personalized medicine.

## Project Scope

This project focuses on developing a system to recognize and transcribe various handwritten elements found in medical documents, including free-form text, medical abbreviations and symbols, and structured information such as prescriptions and lab reports.

## Design and Implementation

### System Architecture

The system architecture is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are widely used for analyzing visual imagery and consist of input layers, hidden layers performing convolutions, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and normalization layers.

### Data Preprocessing

The dataset obtained from medical institutions was refined and labeled. Images were annotated using Roboflow Studio, and bounding boxes were created for individual characters. The dataset was then separated at the character level for training.

### Detection

Object detection, a branch of computer vision, enables machines to identify and locate specific objects within images. Transfer learning was employed using the VGG16 architecture for training the model on the dataset. VGG16 is a deep Convolutional Neural Network known for its lightweight architecture and strong performance in image classification tasks.

## Conclusion

This project aims to bridge the communication gap between healthcare providers by accurately transcribing handwritten medical documents. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we strive to improve patient care, increase efficiency, and enhance data accessibility in the medical field.
